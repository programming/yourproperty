## Upon attaining MOP, Mr and Mrs Lim wanted to sell their flat and upgrade to a condo.

## Selling Price (SP) = $500,000

## HDB Loan Balance = $169,663

## CPF Used (inclusive of accrued interest) = $171,324

## Cash Proceeds = SP - Loan balance - CPF used = $159,013

## Detailed financial planning and calculation is done.

# With a combined income of $6,000, Mr and Mrs Lim are able to upgrade to a condo along with cash reserves of $150,000.

## What happens if Mr and Mrs Lim sell after 25 years and choose to downgrade?

## Selling price (SP) = $550,000

## HDB Loan Balance = $0

## CPF Used (inclusive of accrued interest) = $564,960

## Cash Proceeds = SP - Loan balance - CPF Used = -$14,960

# Mr and Mrs Lim are faced with a negative sale.
