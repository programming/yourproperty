## Step 1: Apply for NTUC membership to enjoy funding from NTUC

* NTUC members are given funding to subsidise part of the fees going towards paying for the RES course.
* This funding is known as UTAP and members get to claim 50% of what you paid (up to $250 per year).
* Example: The course costs $750, you pay $500 using your SkillsFuture credits and you pay $250 cash. UTAP will allow you to claim $125.

## Step 2: Apply for the RES course at an approved course provider 

* Decide on your commitment, be it part-time or full-time.
* Typically, for part-time, classes will be held in the evenings and the entire course will last 1 month.
* For full-time, classes will be held during the day and the entire course will last 2 weeks. 
* Is it important which course provider to sign up with?
