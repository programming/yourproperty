## How many property transactions do you think will a typical Singaporean go through in a lifetime?

- - -

For the sake of this article, I will use the average Singaporean couple as an example.

* During the course of their studies, the couple decided to apply for their first home: a BTO flat
* They finish their studies in their early to mid 20s
* Within the next 2 to 3 years, the couple receive the keys to their BTO flat
* As the couple approach their early to mid 30s, with moderate progression in their careers, based on asset planning by their real estate consultant, the couple sells their BTO flat upon the completion of the 5 year MOP 
* From the cash proceeds, the couple have cash reserves of $100,000 and purchase their second home: a private property
* Towards their late 30s to early 40s, as part of retirement planning, the couple purchase an investment property
* Upon retirement, the couple will have 2 fully paid properties

From the example, the couple completed 4 property transactions

## To answer the above question, the typical Singaporean is likely to go through 3 to 4 property transactions in a lifetime.
