## Step 1: Apply for NTUC membership to enjoy funding from NTUC

* NTUC members are given funding to subsidise part of the fees going towards paying for the RES course.
* This funding is known as UTAP and members get to claim 50% of what you paid (up to $250 per year).
* Example: The course costs $750, you pay $500 using your SkillsFuture credits and you pay $250 cash. UTAP will allow you to claim $125.

## Step 2: Apply for the RES course at an approved course provider 

* Decide on your commitment, be it part-time or full-time.
* Typically, for part-time, classes will be held in the evenings and the entire course will last 1 month.
* For full-time, classes will be held during the day and the entire course will last 2 weeks. 
* Is it important which course provider to sign up with?
* Personally, I don't think it matters. It is better to choose a course provider that is either nearer to your home or your workplace. You will have to achieve at least 75% attendance to obtain the RES course completion certificate.

## Step 3: Attend the RES course 

* As mentioned in the previous step, you will have to achieve at least 75% attendance to obtain the RES course completion certificate.
* You are likely to be an adult learner and have not attended school or taken any exams in the last 5 years or more. Remember that the decision to take the RES course was made by you and it is YOUR CHOICE. 
* Please **PAY ATTENTION** in class. This will make the difference between a pass and a fail.
* If you are unclear about anything, please ask the trainer.
* If possible, I recommend forming study groups as this will help to motivate you to study better.

## Step 4: Apply for the RES exam

* Upon completion of the course, try to apply for the RES exam early.
* I highly recommend taking the next available exam as there may be changes to policies and regulations which will affect the content tested in the exam. Your memory is also likely to be freshest.
* There is a deadline to apply for the exam. However, if full capacity is reached, you will have to wait for the next exam date.
* RES exams are scheduled 3 times a year (February, June and October)

## Step 5: Taking the RES exam

* The only stationery that you are allowed to bring are pencils, erasers and a calculator.
* When I was taking the exam, pencils and erasers were provided by the examiners.
* Remember to bring a jacket as the exam venue can be cold.
* Try not to bring valuables as you would be required to place all other personal belongings in the front of the exam venue.
* As long as you are not late for the exam, you can study outside the exam venue and enter at the very last minute (that's what I did). I felt that it was effective for me as I probably scored a few more points because of last minute studying.
